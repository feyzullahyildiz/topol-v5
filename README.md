# Drag and Drop Email Generator App

This is a simple proof-of-concept (POC) application that mimics the basic functionality of [topol.io](https://topol.io) â€” allowing users to create emails using drag-and-drop blocks.

ðŸ”— [Live Demo](https://topol-clone.netlify.app/)

> You can send emails with Resend API key. Visit here to create it https://resend.com/api-keys
> It does not require credit card. By the way you can only send your own email address on free tier.

> Dont forget to set env. Or you need to type it every time while sending an email.
